## Getting Started


First, run the test:

```bash
npm run test
```

```bash
using jest for unittest
```

## Backend Test

Permutation : we will find the all shuffling case from string
```bash
Example case : 
When we send parameter <string> "ab" so should return with => [ab,ba] for all shufflings case
```
findTheOddInt : we will check int in array if in array contains with interger that appears an odd number of times so should we return that integer 

```bash
Example case : 
[1,1,2] so should return 2 
```

CountSmiley : we will find the perfect smiley so we the perfect smiley is

Rules for a smiling face:
- Each smiley face must contain a valid pair of eyes. Eyes can be marked as : or ;
- A smiley face can have a nose but it does not have to. Valid characters for a nose are - or ~
- Every smiling face must have a smiling mouth that should be marked with either ) or D

  then if we found the perfect smiley same as the case above we will count 1 time and we need to check in every items in array

```bash
Example case : 
countSmileys([':)', ';(', ';}', ':-D']);       // should return 2;
```
